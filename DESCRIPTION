Description: DANA is an approach for assessing the performance of normalization 
    for microRNA-Seq data based on biology-motivated and data-driven metrics.
    DANA takes advantage of well-known biological features of microRNAs for 
    their expression pattern and polycistronic clustering to assess 
    (1) how effectively normalization removes handling effects and 
    (2) how normalization biases true biological signals.
    DANA can assess any normalization method (under minimal assumptions) for 
    any microRNA-Seq data set and only requires additional information on 
    polycistronic clustering or marker location on the genome, 
    which is typically readily available.
